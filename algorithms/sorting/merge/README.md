# Merge Sort

Merge sort is a recursive sorting algorithm which utilizes the divide and
conquer concept. It works by taking a set of data, splitting it into two
halves, and merging those two halves in sorted order. For example:

If we have a set: `[3, 1, 6, 0, 5]`

We split that into two halves `[3, 1, 6]` and `[0, 5]`. We then split those
halves into halves again: `[3, 1]` and `[6]` and `[0]` and `[5]`. We split the last
half into two and then we begin the merge as we bubble back up:

On one side we get back `[1, 3]` and `[6]`
On the other side we get back `[0, 5]`

Into the next step we get `[1, 3, 6]` and `[0, 5]`.

In the final merge at the top, we get `[0, 1, 3, 5, 6]` giving us the sorted
set.

The merge technique used here checks if both the left and right sets have
values in it. If they do, it finds which element at the 0 index of each set
is smaller. It adds that value to the resulting set and runs the check
again. Since it is common then to have one set be finished while the other
is not, we do a final step of appending the left or right values onto the
end of our resulting set to get the full set back sorted.

## Time Complexity

| Case      | Complexity  |
| --------- |:-----------:|
| Worst     | `O(n lg n)` |
| Best      | `O(n lg n)` |
| Average   | `O(n lg n)` |
