# Contributing

Thank you for showing interest in this project! As it currently stands, I will
not be accepting pull requests for items on my list that have not been
completed. I say this because for me, I'm working on learning these concepts
and practice of implementation is important to me. Instead of submitting my
own pull requests on repositories like this, I decided to reinvent the wheel
and do things as I learn them to get a better grasp of how each of these items
works.

I will accept pull requests for modifications and especially performance-based
gains. The only thing that I ask is that in your pull request, please explain
why you are submitting the change. If it's something that I haven't read or is
common practice, I want to know so I can get better!

I will also accept pull requests on the usage of Golang. I'm not a Golang
expert so the way I do things may not be the best for the language and I
accept that as I'm also learning more about that as I go. Like before, if you
submit a pull request on the code quality, please explain to me why this is
more suited so I can learn.

Ultimately, I want to absorb all the knowledge that I can by doing this
project. I appreciate any help or advice offered in this process.
