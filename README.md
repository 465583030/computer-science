# Data-Structures and Algorithms in Golang

In an effort to learn more Golang and understand computer science concepts
better, I'm pairing the two in order to multiply my efforts. This repo's
design is based off that of [arnauddri](https://github.com/arnauddri/algorithms).
I merely took the structure and CS concepts as reference and ignored the
actual implementations.

## What I Want to Learn

* How to write Idiomatic Golang code
* How to write tests for Golang code
* How to implement common data structures
* Which algorithms are most efficient for sorting / searching
