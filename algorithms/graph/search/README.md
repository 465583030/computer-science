# Breadth-First Search (Graph)

Breadth-first search is a method of traversing and searching tree / graph
data structures. The basic concept is starting at a base vertex, we check
the nearest neighbors assigning a distance from the base vertex and the
vertex which leads to it. We then visit the neighbors of those neighbors
until each vertex has been visited.

For example, if we have a graph represented as an adjacency list:

```
0: [1],
1: [0, 4, 5],
2: [3, 4, 5],
3: [2, 6],
4: [1, 2],
5: [1, 2, 6],
6: [3, 5],
7: []
```

We can choose to start at vertex 3. Since it has no parent, we set it as a
null-like value and set the distance to this as 0 since it's the base
vertex. We then look to see the nearest neighbor vertices which in this
case is vertex 2.

With vertex 2, we set the distance to 1 and the parent to our base. Since
there are no more neighbors at a distance of 1, we find the vertices which
vertex 2 leds to. These are the new neighbors and they are vertex 4 and
vertex 5.

This pattern continues until each vertex has been assigned values. If we
already visited the vertex, we skip it. In the end, you will have a mapping
of each vertex with the distance from the base vertex and the vertex that
leads to it. This is important because it allows us to:

- Build a tree based on the distances
- Find the shortest path from one vertex to another
- Draw paths between vertices

In this algorith, a Queue is used to keep track of the next vertices it
needs to visit. This allows us to iterate through the neighbors and then
pop those off the queue to get their next neighbors.

## Time Complexity

`|V|` represents the number of vertices and `|E|` represents the number of edges.

| Case      | Complexity     |
| --------- |:--------------:|
| Find      | `O(|V| + |E|)` |
